# Get started
To correctly install and execute the application:
1) dowload it on your local device. You can do it by choicing between:
   - clicking on Code > Downlad ZIP 
   - excute on your prompt the command git clone https://github.com/ardiz99/TBAse.git
2) enter in the folder TBAse/src
3) run the command docker-compose up --build. If you don't have Docker installed you can download it from here https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
4) when the container are running, in another terminal (prompt command!! Powershell wouldn't work!) run the command docker exec -i db mysql -uroot -proot_password < ./db/ase.sql
5) try the APIs that you want. All the possible APIs are documented in the TBAse/doc folder, in OpenAPI files that you can import in swagger. To do this just open Swagger Editor (https://editor.swagger.io/) > File > Import File > select the .yaml file path that you'd like to see.
